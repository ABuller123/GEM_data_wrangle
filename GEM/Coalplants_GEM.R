# Plants that are announced or under construction, but we have no indication on when they are finished are kicked out.

GEM_relevant <- GEM_relevant[!(GEM_relevant$Status %in% c("announced", "construction","pre-permit", "permitted") &

###Several units from plants have slightly different coordinates
## we take for these cases the average coordinate and match that to the unique location id
# Ensure Latitude and Longitude are numeric
GEM_relevant <- GEM_relevant %>%
  mutate(Latitude = as.numeric(Latitude), Longitude = as.numeric(Longitude))

# Process the data
GEM_summary <- GEM_relevant %>%
  group_by(`GEM location ID`) %>%
  summarise(
    unique_latlong = n_distinct(Latitude, Longitude),  # Count unique lat-long pairs
    Latitude = ifelse(unique_latlong > 1, mean(Latitude), first(Latitude)),  # Mean if multiple, keep as is otherwise
    Longitude = ifelse(unique_latlong > 1, mean(Longitude), first(Longitude))  # Same for Longitude
  ) %>%
  select(-unique_latlong)  # Drop helper column


#Replace Latitude and Longitude in GEM_relevant with those from GEM_summary
GEM_relevant <- GEM_relevant %>%
  select(-Latitude, -Longitude) %>%  # Remove old Latitude & Longitude
  left_join(GEM_summary, by = "GEM location ID")  # Join new values


# Next steps
# we have the asset ID and location ID, an asset ID is unique to the part of the plant
#
# proposal: We create the timelines for each asset ID, then sum up on the Location ID
# bigger propblem is that we dont have the parent id. , would need to make one up
# Also solar, wind nuclear dont have parent column, they have owner column but no ownership %

# Hydro has it with %
# Bioenergy has it with %

#how to deal with a plant that has multiple units, and one unit is owned partly by another company
#' option 1: Create the entire asset capacity pathway, make each company hold respective share of total capacity
#' option 2: sepearate the asset pathway beforehand, make the forecast, then aggregate on plant location and owner
#' 1 is more easy, 2 seems more correct
#'
#' One more thing is the remaining plant lifetime, this corresponds to the planned retirement column, but
#' not always is a planned retirement given. so what do we assume here? that the plant is just rolled over?
#' I feel this is critical information, but not sure how to take this into account yet


## creating the timeline
# each plant unit is here as a standalone row, not like in steel, where it was related to main plants

# Function to split ownership and distribute capacity
# each unit is split up into its different owners, and the capacity is alocated based on ownership shares
split_ownership <- function(df) {
  df %>%
    # Separate multiple owners into different rows
    separate_rows(Owner, sep = ";\\s*") %>%
    # Extract the company name and percentage
    mutate(
      Company = str_extract(Owner, "^[^\\[]+"),  # Extract company name before [
      Ownership = as.numeric(str_extract(Owner, "\\d+(?=%)")) / 100,  # Extract percentage and convert to decimal
      Capacity_allocated = `Capacity (MW)` * Ownership  # Adjusted capacity
    ) %>%
    select(-Owner, -Ownership, -"Capacity (MW)") %>%  # Remove unneeded columns
    rename(Owner = Company)  # Rename for clarity
}

# Apply function to the dataset
GEM_cleaned <- split_ownership(GEM_relevant)

# Remove rows where GEM unit/phase ID is NA
GEM_cleaned <- GEM_cleaned %>%
  filter(!is.na(`GEM unit/phase ID`))


# Remove rows where Planned retirement is before 2024
GEM_cleaned <- GEM_cleaned %>%
  filter(is.na(`Planned retirement`) | `Planned retirement` >= 2024)



##
# Define the time range
years <- 2023:2050

# Function to create a time series for each row
expand_time_series <- function(df) {
  df %>%
    # Expand dataset by adding a row for each year in the time series
    tidyr::crossing(year = years) %>%

        year < `Start year` ~ 0,  # Before start year, capacity is 0
        !is.na(`Planned retirement`) & year >= `Planned retirement` & `Planned retirement` <= 2050 ~ 0,  # After planned retirement, if within range
        TRUE ~ Capacity_allocated  # Otherwise, capacity stays constant
